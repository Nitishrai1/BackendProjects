## Todo Application
It is a simple todo application
It has the following features

Anyone can create a todo
Anyone can update todo
Anyonbe can mark the todo done

Prop drilling: it is some thing that passing the states to the child component whenever the state is used by the childcomponent but it makes the code so ugly to read hence the context api come into the picture 

Context api: it is used to do the state management also it helps the send the data directly to the component which need it thus save us from prop drilling  also lets keep all state logic outside of your core react component
syntax to create a context api is as follows


create a funciton and export the function 

wrapp the component which will use the context api for their uses 
<CountContext.Provider value={count}>
  <Count setCount={SetCount}>
</CountContext.Provider>;

Now you can use this context api in your code whenever you want to use this component you just need to wriote thos
const count=useContext(CountContext); // this will let you to use the count state vriabel inside the child component


Q: why do we need context api?
Ans: we need context api to make the syntax more cleaner and to get rid of the prop drilling which helps the user to understand the code more well it does not used to to make the renderfing of the component more profeciant 


  Now their is a drawback of context api that the componwnt which does not take the props ad inuput also render to overcome this drawback the recoil comes into the picture

Recoil:  It has a concept of an atom to store the state
An atom can be defined outside the component
can be teleported to any component

Web hooks : it is used when we make any payment gateway and let suppose i have closed my browser after doing the payment but when the razor pay tells that the item has been purchaed but now my browser is dowm so insted of telling to my borwser web hooks are you to tell to my backend whichh is always runing
it is just as a service like SMS as a serive , file as a service 










The uniqueness i want to built in my todo app are as follows

1. Analytics Dashboard
Implement an analytics dashboard to show user productivity stats. This can include graphs showing how many tasks were completed each day, average task completion time, tasks by category, etc.

Feature: Visual insights (bar charts, pie charts) into user productivity.
Impact: Adds value by helping users track their progress and identify patterns.


2. Todo Suggestions Based on Usage Patterns
Use machine learning or data analysis to suggest similar todos or repeat tasks based on the user's past behavior. This could include recurring tasks or auto-suggestions based on keywords or categories the user frequently uses.

Feature: Smart suggestions for recurring tasks or common categories.
Impact: Makes task creation faster and reduces user input effort.


3. Reminders and Notifications with Integrations
Integrate push notifications, email, or SMS reminders for upcoming or overdue tasks. You can also integrate with calendar applications like Google Calendar to sync todos as events.

Feature: Push notifications, calendar integration, and reminders.
Impact: Enhances usability by making sure users never miss a task.

These are the uniqure feature which will make my resume stand out of the box




Great to hear about your MERN stack project named "Tasky"! Here are some unique features you could consider adding to your task management app to make it stand out:

1. Task Prioritization
Allow users to set priority levels for each task (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
Tasks could be color-coded based on their priority to provide visual emphasis.
2. Smart Task Suggestions
Implement a recommendation system that suggests tasks based on the user's habits, location, or time of day.
For example, if a user often completes similar tasks on a particular day, the app can suggest adding a task related to that pattern.
3. Recurring Tasks with Custom Intervals
Enable users to set recurring tasks with flexible intervals (e.g., every 3 days, every second Tuesday of the month).
This feature is helpful for routines that don't fall into standard weekly or daily schedules.
4. Task Dependencies
Allow users to create dependencies between tasks, where one task can't be started or completed until another one is finished.
This can be visually represented with a task flowchart to show how tasks are connected.
5. Gamification Elements
Introduce a points or reward system for completing tasks to keep users motivated.
Users could earn badges or rewards for reaching milestones or streaks of productivity.
6. Time Tracking
Add a time-tracking feature to monitor how much time a user spends on each task.
Provide a summary of the time spent on tasks weekly or monthly to help users analyze their productivity.
7. AI-Based Task Suggestions
Integrate AI to analyze user patterns and suggest optimal times to schedule tasks.
Provide smart reminders that adjust based on the user's previous behavior (e.g., reminding more frequently for tasks that are often delayed).
8. Task Collaboration
Allow users to share tasks with friends, family, or team members.
Add options for assigning tasks to specific people with deadlines and progress tracking.
9. Voice Commands Integration
Implement voice command functionality to add, update, or delete tasks.
Integrate with popular voice assistants like Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa to manage tasks hands-free.
10. Task Categories with Custom Icons
Enable users to create custom categories with unique icons or colors to organize their tasks better.
This allows for better task management and visual differentiation.
11. Calendar View
Provide a calendar view for tasks so users can see their upcoming schedule at a glance.
Highlight the most critical or overdue tasks on the calendar.
12. Data Analytics Dashboard
Create a dashboard that provides analytics about the user's tasks, such as completion rates, most productive times of day, or average time to complete tasks.
Offer insights to help users improve their time management.
13. Offline Support with Data Sync
Allow users to access their tasks offline, with changes synced automatically when they come back online.
This ensures that users can manage their tasks even without an internet connection.
14. Integrate Pomodoro Technique
Add a Pomodoro timer to help users focus on tasks using the Pomodoro technique.
Track how many Pomodoro sessions were used to complete a task and offer insights for better focus.
15. Location-Based Reminders
Use geolocation to set reminders based on the user's location.
For example, remind the user to buy groceries when they are near a specific store.
16. Advanced Search and Filters
Implement advanced search options to find tasks quickly based on keywords, due dates, tags, or priority.
Add filtering capabilities to display only relevant tasks based on user preferences.
17. Theme Customization
Offer various themes and color schemes so users can personalize the look of the app.
Include a dark mode and allow users to set custom background images or colors.
18. Integrate with Third-Party Apps
Allow integration with productivity tools like Google Calendar, Outlook, Slack, or Trello.
Enable tasks to be automatically added to these tools or receive reminders through them.
19. End-of-Day or Weekly Summaries
Send users a summary of their tasks completed or pending at the end of each day or week.
Include motivational quotes or tips based on their progress to encourage productivity.
20. Task Templates
Provide a feature to save task templates for frequently repeated tasks.
Allow users to quickly create new tasks based on these templates to save time.
