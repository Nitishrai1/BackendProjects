## Todo Application
It is a simple todo application
It has the following features

Anyone can create a todo
Anyone can update todo
Anyonbe can mark the todo done

Prop drilling: it is some thing that passing the states to the child component whenever the state is used by the childcomponent but it makes the code so ugly to read hence the context api come into the picture 

Context api: it is used to do the state management also it helps the send the data directly to the component which need it thus save us from prop drilling  also lets keep all state logic outside of your core react component
syntax to create a context api is as follows


create a funciton and export the function 

wrapp the component which will use the context api for their uses 
<CountContext.Provider value={count}>
  <Count setCount={SetCount}>
</CountContext.Provider>;

Now you can use this context api in your code whenever you want to use this component you just need to wriote thos
const count=useContext(CountContext); // this will let you to use the count state vriabel inside the child component


Q: why do we need context api?
Ans: we need context api to make the syntax more cleaner and to get rid of the prop drilling which helps the user to understand the code more well it does not used to to make the renderfing of the component more profeciant 


  Now their is a drawback of context api that the componwnt which does not take the props ad inuput also render to overcome this drawback the recoil comes into the picture

Recoil:  It has a concept of an atom to store the state
An atom can be defined outside the component
can be teleported to any component

The uniqueness i want to built in my todo app are as follows

1. Analytics Dashboard
Implement an analytics dashboard to show user productivity stats. This can include graphs showing how many tasks were completed each day, average task completion time, tasks by category, etc.

Feature: Visual insights (bar charts, pie charts) into user productivity.
Impact: Adds value by helping users track their progress and identify patterns.


2. Todo Suggestions Based on Usage Patterns
Use machine learning or data analysis to suggest similar todos or repeat tasks based on the user's past behavior. This could include recurring tasks or auto-suggestions based on keywords or categories the user frequently uses.

Feature: Smart suggestions for recurring tasks or common categories.
Impact: Makes task creation faster and reduces user input effort.


3. Reminders and Notifications with Integrations
Integrate push notifications, email, or SMS reminders for upcoming or overdue tasks. You can also integrate with calendar applications like Google Calendar to sync todos as events.

Feature: Push notifications, calendar integration, and reminders.
Impact: Enhances usability by making sure users never miss a task.
